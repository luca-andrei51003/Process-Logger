1. How many INFO/DEBUG/ERROR logs per type of app (INFO 2 entries count as one log)
2. Average sucessful run time per type of app (Frontend, Backend, API) - not SYSTEM
3. How many times each app (Frontend, Backend, API, System) failed throughout the day
4. App with the most failed runs (ERROR) and how many 
5. App with the most succesful runs (INFO) and how many
6. Which third of day (00:00:00 - 07:59:59/08:00:00-15:59:59/16:00:00-23:59:59) had the most failed runs
7. Calculate the longest and shortest successful run times across all types of apps (Frontend, Backend, API). 
Provide the timestamps for these occurrences
8. Identify the hour of the day (eg., 00:00:00-00:59:00, 01:00:00-01:59:00 etc.) when each app type (Frontend, Backend, API) 
had the most activities (INFO/ERROR/DEBUG)
9. Calculate the failure rate percentage for each app type. (Failure rate = (No. of ERROR logs) / (Total logs of that app type) * 100)
